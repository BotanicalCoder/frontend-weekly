Add a summary for [session title](frontend-weekly session url).

## Note
- We prefer video summaries to be 2 or 3 paragraphs long. Summaries could be longer if absolutely necessary. You should add a bullet list of things the viewer will learn at the end.
- Summaries should be written in markdown.
- Summaries should be saved in the `src/session-summaries` folder.
- Summary files should be named with the session slug e.g The slug for the [Design Systems Part 2](https://frontendweekly.dev/sessions/design-systems-part-2) video is `design-systems-part-2`, so the summary file for that session should be named `design-systems-part-2.md`.
- Select the `Session Summary PR Template` when making a Pull Request.
