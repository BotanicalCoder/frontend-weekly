# Frontend Weekly

The Code that powers [Frontendweekly.dev](https://frontendweekly.dev).

## Contributing
A contribution guide is being worked on. In the meantime, be kind, compassionate, patient and respectful to everyone here.

If you notice an issue that requires fixing, file an issue. You're welcome to work on the issue as well.

If you want to help fix an issue, raise a PR. We encourage the use of git workflow.

Before you start working on an issue, please assign yourself to the issue. This would let other interested parties know you're working on it and possibly collaborate with you on it.

For session summaries, see the section below.

### Session Summaries
When filing an issue for a missing session summary, use the `Session Summary Issue Template`.
